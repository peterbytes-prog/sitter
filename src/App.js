      <h2>About Stellar Sitting Services</h2>
      <p>
        At Stellar, we take pride in our exceptional customer service. We began our business with one employee - Janie Stellar, owner and founder. Janie's reputation for trustworthy and caring service grew over the years, as did the company. Stellar now employs over 300 sitters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every one of our sitters has completed extensive security checks, along with intensive training on pet care, home care, and security/emergency procedures. You can trust a Stellar sitter!
